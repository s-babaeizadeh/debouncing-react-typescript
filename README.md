𝗗𝗲𝗯𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 is a handy technique that helps make your code more efficient when it needs to run multiple times in a short period. Essentially, it allows you to delay the execution of a function until there’s been a pause in user activity.

For instance, think about a search bar that shows suggestions as you type. Without debouncing, it could make an API call for every single keystroke, which might overwhelm the server or provide too many irrelevant results. By using debouncing, you can set things up so that the API call only happens after the user stops typing for a couple of seconds.

Implementing debouncing involves using a timer. You can use setTimeout to set a delay for when your function executes and clearTimeout to cancel the timer if the user keeps typing. This ensures that the function runs just once after the user has finished their input, making everything run more smoothly.
